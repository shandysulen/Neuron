# Neuron - Neuronal Spike Train Modeling
A Python model for neuronal spikes triggered by dendritic spikes from input Poisson neurons that generate output spike trains in a single neuron.
## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you in obtaining an up-and-running copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Neuron is being developed with Python 3.6.4 which can be downloaded by heading to the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and downloading the appropriate package for your local machine.

*Note: If given the option during the installation process, be sure to add the install directory in the PATH environment variable on your local machine. This allows you to run the Python interpreter in any development working directory.*

Next, you will need [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (Python Package Index), but luckily PIP comes packaged in all binary installers starting with Python 3.4.

*Note: For ease of use it is recommended that you also add the directory path that PIP lies in to the PATH environment variable on your local machine for ease of access.*

### Installation
Navigate to the directory that holds `pip.exe` (or if the directory path is included in your local machine's PATH environment variable, navigate anywhere) and install the following required modules:

`$ pip install matplotlib numpy`
